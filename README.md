* **Python:**  Programming language for the backend.
* **Uvicorn/Gunicorn:**  Asynchronous server for deploying the FastAPI application.
* **Database (Choose one - e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite):** For persistent data storage (specify which you are using).
* **Dependencies:** (List key Python dependencies, e.g., `pydantic`, `SQLAlchemy` if using SQL, `motor` if using MongoDB, `openai`, etc. -  Consider generating a `requirements.txt` file and referencing it here).

**Frontend (React):**

* **React:**  JavaScript library for building the user interface.
* **JavaScript/TypeScript:**  Frontend programming language (specify if using TypeScript).
* **npm/yarn:**  Package managers for frontend dependencies.
* **Styling Libraries (Optional - e.g., Material UI, Tailwind CSS):** For UI component and styling (specify if using any).
* **Dependencies:** (List key frontend dependencies, e.g., `axios`, `react-router-dom`, etc. - Consider generating a `package.json` and referencing it).

**AI Integration:**

* **OpenAI API:**  For accessing OpenAI's language models (e.g., GPT-3, etc.).
* **OpenAI Python Library:**  For interacting with the OpenAI API from the backend.

**Agentic Architecture Components (Conceptual - Describe your specific architecture in more detail if possible):**

* **Agent Framework (If using one - e.g., LangChain, AutoGen -  Specify if applicable):**  Framework for building and managing agents.
* **Agent Types (Describe briefly - e.g., Planning Agent, Suggestion Agent, Task Agent, etc.):**  Different agents responsible for specific tasks and functionalities within the system.
* **Communication Mechanism (Between agents and between agents and user interface):** How agents interact and exchange information (e.g., message queues, direct function calls).

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the Agentic Event Planner up and running:

**1. Prerequisites:**

* **Python 3.8+:**  Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
* **Node.js and npm (or yarn):**  Required for the React frontend.
* **OpenAI API Key:**  You will need an OpenAI API key to utilize the AI features.  Obtain one from the [OpenAI website](https://platform.openai.com/).
* **Database Setup:** (If applicable -  Describe database setup. E.g., "Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and running. Create a database named `event_planner_db` and user with appropriate privileges.")
* **Environment Variables:** You'll need to configure environment variables for both the backend and frontend.

**2. Backend Setup (FastAPI):**

```bash
cd backend
# (Optional) Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install backend dependencies

# Configure Environment Variables:
# Create a .env file in the `backend` directory
# Example .env file content:
# DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database_name" (Adjust for your database)
# OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"

uvicorn main:app --reload  # Run the FastAPI backend in development mode (for testing)
# or
# gunicorn -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker main:app --bind 0.0.0.0:8000  # For production deployment
3. Frontend Setup (React):

Bash

cd frontend
npm install  # Install frontend dependencies

# Configure Environment Variables:
# Create a .env.local file in the `frontend` directory (for local development)
# or set environment variables in your deployment environment.
# Example .env.local file content:
# REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8000"  # URL of your FastAPI backend

npm start  # Start the React development server
# or
# npm run build  # Build for production and serve the `build` folder with a static server
4. Accessing the Application:

Frontend: Once the React frontend is running, you should be able to access the application in your browser, typically at http://localhost:3000.
Backend API: The FastAPI backend API will be running at the URL you configured (e.g., http://localhost:8000). You can test API endpoints using tools like Postman or curl.
